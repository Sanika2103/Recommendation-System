# Movie Recommendation System
<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>A recommender system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly. An example of recommendation in action is when you visit Amazon and you notice that some items are being recommended to you or when Netflix recommends certain movies to you. They are also used by Music streaming applications such as Spotify and Deezer to recommend music that you might like.</p>
